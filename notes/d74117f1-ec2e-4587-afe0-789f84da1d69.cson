  # Sub_queries in Sql
  
  ### Sub_squeries in `WHERE` clause
  ```sql
  SELECT column1
  FROM table
  WHERE column2 = (SELECT MAX(column2) FROM table)
  ```
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
  ```
  - just trying to use `salary > AVG(salary)` gives the error message: invalid use of an aggregate function
  
  ### Column Expressions
  sub_queries in the `SELECT` clause
  ```sql
  SELECT employee_id, salary,
    (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) as avg_salary
  FROM employees
  ```
  
  ### Derived Tables or Table Expressions
  sub_queries in the `FROM` clause
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM
    (SELECT employee_id, employee_name FROM employees)
    as employee4all
  ```
  (Makes more sence with joint tables.)
